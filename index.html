    It was following a chance meeting with legendary singer Maxi Priest backstage at his concert that DeMoya and Maxi formed a strong collaborative relationship. DeMoya was introduced to producer Livingstone Brown and together the three of them set to work creating a brand new project that put DeMoya front and centre.
